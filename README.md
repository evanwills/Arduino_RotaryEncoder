# `RotaryEncode` & `BtnRotaryEncoder`

These two classes seek to make using rotary encoders easier

`BtnRotaryEncoder` acts as a [decorator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern) for [`FlexibleButtons`](https://github.com/evanwills/FlexibleButtons)

## `RotaryEncoder`:

__`long getPosition( [unsigned int tempIncrement] )`__ returns the current position of the encoder. If called with tempIncrement passed the output is adjusted by the tempIncrment value rather increment value set within the object

__`long getPositionLimited(long min, long max[, unsigned int tempIncrement])`__ returns the current (cumulative) position of the rotary encoder but limits the position to within the minimum/maximum. e.g.
*	if min is -5 and max is 10 and the position is 13. Then the position will be adjusted to 10.
*	if min is -5 and max is 10 and the position is -12. Then the position will be adjusted to -5.
*	if min is -5 and max is 10 and the position is 44. Then the position will be adjusted to 10.

__`long getPositionLoopAround(long min, long max[, unsigned int tempIncrement])`__ returns the current (cumulative) position of the rotary encoder but loops the position around to the other end when the minimum or maximum is reached. e.g.
*	if min is -5 and max is 10 and the position is 13. Then the position will be adjusted to -2.<br />`((13 - 10) + -5)`
*	if min is -5 and max is 10 and the position is -12. Then the position will be adjusted to 3.<br />`(10 - (-5 - -12))`
*	if min is -5 and max is 10 and the position is 44. Then the position will be adjusted to -1	.<br />`((44 - 10) + -5) = 29` _(still too big so adjust again)_<br />`((29 - 10) + -5) = 14` _(still too big so adjust again)_<br />`((14 - 10) + -5) = -1` _(now within range)_

NOTE: the adjustment happens in a loop so that regardless of the starting value, it will always end up within the min/max range


__`unsigned int getIncrement()`__ returns the increment value the object is currently using

__`void setIncrement( unsigned int newIncrement )`__ allows you to set the increment value the object uses for modifying the position of the encoder.

__`void setPosition( long newPosition )`__ allows you to preset the position of the encoder before user moves it. (Useful if you are using the same encoder for multiple variables.)

## `BtnRotaryEncoder`:

Inherits all of the above methods as well as implementing the `FlexibleButtonInterface` making it usable as a normal button. This gives it the flexibility of being able to do any of the [`FlexibleButtons`](https://github.com/evanwills/FlexibleButtons) functions

`FlexibleButtonInterface` methods:

__`isPressed()`__ returns true if the button is pressed

__`getState()`__ returns an integer value for the button's state.
